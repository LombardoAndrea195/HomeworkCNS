1Homework:(Comparison of symmetric ciphers in OpenSSL)

Given a pair of cipher and operating mode evaluate speed-ration and average speed of encryption and decryption-> compare at least 4 ciphers in term of encryption/decryption speed (in OpenSSL). File size should >=100KB . How are the evaluations of these pairs?


2Homework:(Practing with an offline dictionary attack)

Decrypt a given ciphertext obtained by OpenSSL 1.1 using a plaintext as English text and a symmetrick key derived by a word, then vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack. The encryption should be made by AES with 192-bit key in CBC mode. You should use the flag "-pbkdf2"


3Homework:Understanding the Galois Counter Mode(GCM)

Study and understand the usage of GCM and compare the aes-256-gcm to aes-256-cbc in terms of usability and speed


5Homework:(Ro-Sham-Bo)
The main goal is to garantee data integrity developping a new protocol for allowing a secure game between two players. This means that they couldn't try to win without kidding each others. Players will play according the protocol designed but it should garantee that a player doesn't take any vantages.  The protocol should garantee there're no third parties, no MITM no outof the protocol messages, real time playing. 


6Homework:(Public key cryptography in OpenSSL)

Goals are: generating keys with certificates, converting certificates and digital signing. In detail we should generating a pair of keys (private and public) then through them we should generating and verifying a self-signed X.509 ceritifcates, then digitally singing a document and verifying a signature on a document. Following  a particular link selected by the teacher we should be able to convert the certificate formats.
